# Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament

A competitive tournament platform for testing game theory strategies in the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. Write your own strategy in JavaScript, battle against built-in and community strategies (coming soon), and climb the leaderboards.

## What is This?

This is an interactive web application that lets you:
- **Write custom strategies** in JavaScript to play the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
- **Compete in tournaments** where your strategy plays up to 1000 rounds against every other strategy
- **Analyze results** with multiple scoring modes and detailed match visualizations
- **Share strategies** via URL encoding to challenge others

## Future Enhancements

See [MVP.md](./MVP.md) for the full roadmap, including:

- **Backend Integration**: Global tournaments (currently only local competition)
- **Evolution Mode**: Strategies reproduce based on performance, population dynamics
- **Meta-Gaming**: Private strategies, 1v1 challenges, strategy lineage trees
- **Advanced Formats**: Multi-player games, noisy channels, incomplete information
